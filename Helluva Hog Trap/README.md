# Helluva Hog Trap
Spring 2023
The purpose of the website was to provide a visual user interface to a then-SMS-only interface.<br>
Users needed to manage their hog trap systems, visualize the information provided by each trap, and request new information in addition to basic account management. 
<br><br>

I was a frontend developer on this project.<br>
As usual, I iterated on the website on paper before moving to Figma.<br>
The website was created with TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS, and MaterialUI components.
