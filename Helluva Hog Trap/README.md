# Helluva Hog Trap (Spring 2023)

## Purpose
Provide a visual user interface for farmowners which would complement an SMS-only interface.<br>
In addition to basic account management, Farmers can manage their hog trap systems, visualize the information provided by each trap, and request new information. 
<br>

## My Role
I was the frontend developer on this project.<br>
As usual, I iterated on the website on paper before moving to Figma.<br>
The website was created with TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS, and MaterialUI components.
