# Helluva Hog Trap
Spring 2023

I was a frontend developer on this project.<br>
The purpose of the website was to provide a visual user interface to a then-SMS-only interface.
As usual, I iterated on the website on paper before moving to Figma.<br>
The website was created with TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS, and MaterialUI components.
